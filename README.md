# fishtank-room-clicker
Chrome extension to switch cameras by clicking on doors

IMPORTANT: Since the extension isn't on the Chrome Store, you'll have to reinstall it every once in a while

In order to run it you have to
- Click on the Green "Code" button
- Click on "Download Zip"
- Extract the "fishtank-room-clicker-main" folder from that .zip. The files should be right there
- Go to Chrome -> Extensions -> Manage Extensions
- Enable Developer Mode on the top right of the Extensions page
- Click "Load Unpacked" on the top left of the page
- Select the unzipped "fishtank-room-clicker-main" folder that has the files right inside
- Reload your Fishtank page

Upcoming changes:
- Add an option to stay in the Global chatroom regardless of the camera you're watching

Half of it was done using ChatGPT since I barely know js so don't scream at me if it breaks :)
